An express API backing the various Guild Bank clients for the Flat Azeroth Society

## Usage

### Endpoints

#### `/` (Root)

This just responds hello world for now.

## Development

### Installation

I use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You should too.

```
git clone https://github.com/Flat-Azeroth-Society/bank-api
cd bank-api
yarn
```

### Building the app

You can build one-off with:

```
yarn build
```

But I prefer running a watcher:

```
yarn watch
```

### Running the server

```
yarn start
```

### Contribution

Just make PR's, friendos.
